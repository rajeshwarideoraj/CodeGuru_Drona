This means the loop will never exit unless there's a break statement. You need to change this condition to something that will eventually become false.\n\n   - **Hint**: Consider what condition would indicate that you've finished calculating the factorial. \n\n2. **Negative Input Handling**: The current code is attempting to handle negative numbers by converting them to positive, but factorials are only defined for non-negative integers. You might want to add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `num` is non-negative.\n\n   - **Hint**: You could return a specific value or raise an exception if the number is negative to indicate that the factorial cannot be calculated for those values.\n\n3. **Factorial Logic**: Make sure that you are decrementing `num` correctly so that you eventually reach the base case where the loop should stop.\n\n   - **Example Idea**: Think about how you would calculate the factorial for a number like 5. What would the series of multiplications look like?\n\nTry implementing these suggestions, and you should be on the right track to fixing the function! If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on these points, feel free to ask!"
