        "content": "You've made a good attempt at breaking down the logic of the `notAFactorial()` function! However, let's clarify a few points to ensure you fully understand how the loop operates.\n\n1. **Initialization of `total`:** You mentioned that `total` starts at 0. When calculating a factorial, typically, you would want to start `total` at 1, not 0, because multiplying by 0 will always yield 0, which is not the correct result for a factorial.\n\n2. **While Loop Condition:** The condition `while(num == num)` is always true as long as `num` is not altered in a way that it becomes something other than itself. However, if you want to calculate the factorial, you should be checking a condition that depends on reducing `num`, such as `while num > 0`.\n\n3. **Iterations:** You correctly identified that `num` will decrement from 9 to 0. However, the question is about how many times the loop executes. If you start at 9 and go down to 0, that will give you 10 iterations (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0). The loop will stop before it checks `-1`, which would be the 11th check.\n\nSo, to summarize, if `num` starts at 9, the loop will iterate 10 times, not 11. \n\nWhat changes would you consider making to ensure `notAFactorial()` correctly calculates the factorial?"

        "content": "For notAFactorial(), if num is 9 then that means that total is 0 to start and num is not less than 0 therefore we enter the while loop because num is equal to num. After that num is still not less than 0 therefore we enter the else statement where the total is now equal to 0 * 9 which is equal to 0 right? (Because 0 times anything is 0) After that the number is equal to 8 because num = 9 - 1. Then we enter the while loop again because 8 = 8, and again because 7 = 7, and again because 6 = 6, and again because 5 = 5, and again because 4 = 4, and again because 3 = 3, and again because 2 = 2, and again because 1 = 1, and again because 0 = 0, and again because -1 = -1 but on this iteration we break because num < 0. Therefore we iterate through the loop 11 times?"

        "content": "You've done a great job analyzing the flow of the `notAFactorial()` function! However, there's a misunderstanding in how the multiplication and initialization of `total` work. \n\n1. **Initialization of Total**: You mentioned that `total` starts at 0. If you multiply anything by 0, the result will always be 0. Instead, to calculate a factorial, you should start `total` at 1.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**: The while loop condition `while (num == num)` is always true for any number. This will lead to an infinite loop if not addressed correctly. Instead, you should check for a condition that can eventually become false (like checking if `num >= 0`).\n\n3. **Factorial Logic**: Remember, the factorial of a number \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\). Think about how you can build this product using a loop.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Change the initialization of `total` to 1.\n- Modify the while loop to check for a condition that can eventually become false, ensuring the loop will terminate.\n- Ensure that you multiply `total` by `num` instead of the current value of `total` being zero.\n\n### Questions for You:\n- How would you change the initialization of `total` to start with the correct value for multiplying?\n- What condition would you set in the while loop to ensure it stops when you've finished calculating the factorial?\n- Can you think of a way to incorporate the logic of factorial calculation into the loop?\n\nThese points should help you refine the `notAFactorial()` function!"

Think about what condition you could use that will never change.\n\n2. **Common Patterns**: You might consider using `while True:`. This is a common way to create an infinite loop in Python. \n\n3. **Breaking the Loop**: If you want to eventually break out of the loop based on user input, you could still include a check inside the loop. However, if your goal is to loop indefinitely, you might not even need that check.\n\n4. **Example Syntax**: The syntax would look something like this:\n   ```python\n   while True:\n       # your code here\n   ```\n\nTry modifying your `while` loop using these hints, and see how it affects the function!"
