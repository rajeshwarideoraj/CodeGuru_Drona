Are there any conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) involved? What are they checking for?\n\n3. **Check the Print Statements**: If there are any `print` statements in the function, analyze what the function is printing based on different scenarios or inputs.\n\n4. **Test Different Inputs**: Consider what different inputs might yield. You could create test cases to see how the function behaves with various values.\n\n5. **Use Comments**: As you review the code and figure out the logic, write comments in your code explaining what each part does. This will help clarify your understanding.\n\nBy following these steps, you can develop a clearer understanding of how `onlyOneRightAnswer` functions and what it prints, without needing to see the exact answer.

To understand how the `notAFactorial` function works, let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `total` to 0. \n\n2. **Input Handling**: It checks if `num` is less than 0. If it is, it makes `num` positive. However, keep in mind that if `num` is 0 or positive, this check will not change it.\n\n3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while (num == num)` is always true (since any number is equal to itself). This means the loop could run infinitely unless there’s a break condition inside.\n\n4. **Break Condition**: Inside the loop, there’s an `if` statement checking `if num < 0:`. However, since the previous step makes `num` positive if it’s negative, this `if` condition will never be true after that point, and you won't hit the break.\n\n5. **Factorial Calculation**: The `else` part within the loop multiplies `total` by `num` and then decrements `num`. But since `total` is initialized to 0, multiplying 0 by any number will still result in 0.\n\nWith this in mind, can you determine how many times the loop would run when calling `notAFactorial(9)`? What might be a better condition to use in the while loop to properly iterate through the numbers and compute a factorial?"

When the `break` statement is encountered, it immediately terminates the nearest enclosing loop (like a `for` or `while` loop) and control flows to the next statement outside of that loop.\n\nTo help you understand it better, consider a scenario where you are searching for a specific value in a list. If you find that value, you would want to stop searching further. This is where `break` comes in handy.\n\nHere’s a basic syntax example of how `break` is used:\n\n```python\nfor item in my_list:\n    if item == target_value:\n        break  # Exits the loop if the target_value is found\n```\n\nThink about how you might use `break` in your own code.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding Variables**: When you say \"a variable that is set to num,\" you are creating a new variable that holds the same value as `num`. For example, if you have `new_variable = num`, `new_variable` now holds the same value as `num` at that moment.\n\n2. **Multiplying by -1**: When you do `num = num * (-1)`, you are taking the current value of `num`, multiplying it by -1, and then assigning that new value back to `num`. This effectively changes the sign of `num`. \n\n3. **Example**: Let's say `num` starts as `5`. After executing `num = num * (-1)`, `num` would now be `-5`. Conversely, if `num` was `-3`, after the operation, it would become `3`.\n\n4. **Key Concept**: Remember that this operation modifies the original `num` variable. If you want to keep the original value of `num` while also getting the negative, you might want to use a separate variable for that.\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you applied this operation within a loop?

If this condition is true, it prints that the person is a child.\n- The `elif` (else if) checks if the age is less than 20, which means the person is a teenager if the first condition was not met.\n- The `else` handles all other cases, indicating that the person is an adult.\n\nThis structure prioritizes the most specific checks first, which is crucial, as mentioned in your assignment.\n\nNow, how could you apply a similar structure to the `magic8(num)` function mentioned in your assignment?

For example, `9! = 9 * 8 * 7 * ... * 1`. \n\n2. **Function Structure**: Look at how the `notAFactorial` function is structured. What loops or conditions are currently used? \n\n3. **Looping**: Consider how many times the loop will execute with `num = 9`. What condition(s) are being checked in the loop? \n\n    - If the loop is checking a condition like `while (num > 0)`, it would continue until `num` reaches `0`. \n\n4. **Decrementing**: Does the function reduce `num` in each iteration? If so, how does it do that? This is important for ensuring that the loop will eventually stop.\n\n5. **Identifying Issues**: You mentioned there are two issues with the function. As you analyze the loop, consider:\n    - Is the loop condition correct for calculating a factorial?\n    - Is there a proper way to accumulate the product of the numbers?\n\n6. **Returning the Result**: Finally, how does the function return the calculated factorial?
