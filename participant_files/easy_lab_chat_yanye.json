Here are a few questions to help you think through the testing process:\n\n1. **Have you implemented all the conditions?** Review the rules: \n   - What should your function return if `num` is less than 23?\n   - What should it return if `num` is exactly 41?\n   - What about if `num` is less than or equal to 72?\n   - What should it return for values greater than 72?\n\n2. **What test cases have you written?** You should have at least the examples provided in the assignment:\n   - What happens when you call `magic8(-4)`?\n   - What about `magic8(70)`?\n   - Have you added any additional test cases with other numbers?\n\n3. **What are you observing when you run the tests?** Are you getting the expected outputs for each test case? If not, consider the logic in your if statements. \n\nRemember that when writing your conditions, you should check the most specific ones first. Can you identify if your conditions are ordered correctly? \n\nIf you want to share the logic you've used, I can help you identify any potential issues without providing the exact code."

Can you think of a condition that could lead to a break? \n\n2. **Logic for Factorial**: The logic for calculating the factorial seems to be incorrect. What do you think should happen inside the loop? Specifically, the way `total` is updated and initialized seems to be off. How would you typically calculate the factorial of a number?\n\n3. **Total Initialization**: Currently, `total` is initialized to `0`. What do you think would happen if you initialized it to `1` instead? \n\n4. **Negative Numbers**: You have a condition to make `num` positive if it’s negative, but how should factorials be defined for negative numbers? \n\n5. **Breaking Out of the Loop**: You also have a break statement that checks if `num < 0`, but since `num` is made positive at the beginning, this condition will never be true. \n\nTry to reflect on these points and see if you can identify the two key changes that will fix the function to properly compute the factorial. What modifications would you make based on your conclusions?"

Is the function currently implementing that correctly, especially in terms of how it handles the input number?\n\nBy thinking through these points, you should be able to pinpoint what needs to be changed in the `notAFactorial` function to produce a correct factorial output.

What happens to the value of `num` inside the loop? Is it being modified in a way that would affect the loop condition?\n2. If the loop condition is based on `num` being equal to itself, what does that imply about the potential for the loop to end?\n3.

The factorial of a number, often denoted as \\( n! \\), is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to that number \\( n \\). \n\nFor example:\n- \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\)\n- \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 0! \\) is defined to be 1.\n\nTo think about how you might implement a factorial function, consider:\n- What kind of loop or recursion might you use to multiply all the numbers together?\n- How will you handle the base case (like when \\( n \\) is 0 or 1)?\n\nIt’s helpful to break down the steps into smaller parts.
