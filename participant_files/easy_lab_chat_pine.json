For example, the factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is calculated as:\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nIt's important to note that the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1 (0! = 1).\n\nTo think critically about how to implement a factorial in code, consider how you would structure a function to handle this calculation. What kind of loop might you use, and how would you determine when to stop multiplying?"

What are some ways you can stop it or exit the loop if needed? Consider how you might implement a way to break out of that loop based on user input or some other condition. \n\nCan you also think of a scenario where an infinite loop could be useful?"
