Let's break down the issues in `notAFactorial(num)` and think about how to fix them.\n\n1. **Initialization of `total`**: \n   - Right now, you're initializing `total` to `0`. However, to calculate a factorial, you should start with `total` set to `1`. Can you think about why multiplying by `0` will give you an incorrect result?\n\n2. **The condition in the while loop**:\n   - You have `while (num == num)`, which is always true for any integer. This means the loop will run indefinitely if `num` is not changed. What would be a better condition to check for the loop to eventually terminate?\n\n3. **Multiplication Logic**:\n   - In the loop, you're currently doing `total = total * num`. Since `total` starts at `0`, this will always result in `0`. What should you do instead to accumulate the product of the numbers?\n\n4. **Negative Input Handling**:\n   - You've converted negative numbers to positive, which is good, but remember that factorials are not defined for negative numbers. You might want to handle that case differently.\n\n5. **Returning the result**:\n   - The return statement currently is outside the loop, which is fine, but make sure that it returns the correct `total` after the loop has finished calculating the factorial.\n\nUsing these hints, can you try to rewrite the function addressing the points mentioned? If you need more help on any of these points, feel free to ask!"

This will cause an infinite loop.\n\nTo create a meaningful loop, you need a condition that can eventually become false. Here are some ideas to think about:\n\n1. **Changing the Value**: Consider a condition that can change within the loop. For example, you could use a variable that is modified inside the loop.\n\n2. **User Input**: If you're looking to create a loop based on user input, you could check if the input meets a specific condition. For example, you could loop while a user continues to provide valid input.\n\n3. **Specific Condition**: Think about what specific condition would make sense for your loop. What scenario do you want to repeat until a certain point is reached?\n\nCan you think of a condition that would allow the loop to eventually terminate?"

How would you modify a condition to ensure the loop eventually stops? \n\nBy reflecting on these questions, you can identify the right condition for your loop.

How will you ensure that `num` eventually becomes less than or equal to zero?

Consider where you might need to add a return statement.\n\n2. **Function Logic**: What is the logic inside your function? Are you checking the condition correctly? For example, if your function is supposed to do something only when `num > 0`, what should happen if that condition is not met?\n\n3. **Testing Your Function**: How are you calling your function? Make sure you're passing the appropriate values to it when testing.\n\nIf you could share what your function looks like (without giving the exact solution), I can help you identify what might be going wrong!"

Let's think about how to complete the `magic8(num)` function based on the guidelines provided in your assignment.\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditions**: You need to return different strings based on the value of `num`. Can you identify the specific conditions that need to be checked? What do you think the order of these conditions should be?\n\n2. **Using If Statements**: Recall that you should start with the most specific checks first. Which condition do you think is the most specific in your case? For example, how would you check if `num` is exactly 41?\n\n3. **Using Comparison Operators**: For conditions where you check if `num` is less than or less than or equal to a certain value, remember to use the correct comparison operators. What would the syntax look like for these comparisons?\n\n4. **Returning Values**: After each condition, you will need to return a string. What is the correct way to return a string from a function in Python?\n\nHere’s a **basic syntax example** to illustrate how you might structure your if statements:\n\n```python\nif condition1:\n    return \"result1\"\nelif condition2:\n    return \"result2\"\n# Add more conditions as needed\nelse:\n    return \"default result\"\n```\n\n5. **Testing Your Function**: You already have some test cases. Think about what other test cases you could add to ensure your function works as expected.\n\nTry implementing these ideas in your `magic8(num)` function, and you’ll be on the right track!
