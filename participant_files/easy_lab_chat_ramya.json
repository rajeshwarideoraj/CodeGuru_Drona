The first thing it does is prompt the user with the `question` using `input()`. \n\n2. **While Loop**: The `while` statement checks if the user's input is not equal to `correctAnswer`. If it is not equal, the code inside the loop runs, which prints a message and prompts the question again. \n\n3. **Repeat Until Correct**: This loop continues until the user finally inputs the correct answer. So, the function keeps asking the question until the right answer is given.\n\nTo summarize, the function will keep asking the user the same question until they provide the correct answer. \n\nCan you think of a way to modify this function if you wanted to limit the number of attempts the user has?

This means that the loop will technically run indefinitely unless there is a break condition that stops it.\n\n2. **Identifying the Break Condition:** You have an `if` statement inside the loop that checks if `num < 0` and breaks out of the loop if that condition is met. However, since `num` is always non-negative due to the earlier condition (`if num < 0`), this break condition won't be reached while `num` is positive.\n\n3. **Counting the Iterations:** Since the loop will continue infinitely with the current condition (because `num` will never be negative after the initial check), `notAFactorial(9)` will loop indefinitely unless you change the logic inside the loop.\n\n4. **Fixing the Function:** To properly calculate a factorial, think about what needs to change:\n   - The initial value of `total` should be set to 1 (since multiplying by 0 will always result in 0).\n   - You need to ensure that the loop will eventually stop.

        "content": "Great question! To ensure that a loop eventually terminates when a certain condition is met, you typically want to include a way to change the condition within the loop.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to consider:\n\n1. **Condition Check**: You could include a check at the start of your loop to see if `num` is equal to 0. If it is, you can use a `break` statement to exit the loop.\n\n2. **Modify `num`**: Make sure that within the loop, you're modifying the value of `num` in such a way that it will eventually reach 0. This could mean decrementing `num` by 1 or some other operation that brings it closer to 0.\n\n3. **While Loop Structure**: Ensure your `while` loop's condition is something that will eventually evaluate to `False`. For instance, if your loop condition is something like `while num != 0`, this will allow the loop to run until `num` is 0.\n\nHere’s a conceptual example of what the structure might look like:\n\n```python\nwhile num != 0:\n    # perform operations\n    num -= 1  # This will help eventually reach 0, if num starts greater than 0\n```\n\nThink about how you can integrate these ideas into your code.

For example, \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\). \n\n2. **Identifying Issues**: \n   - The initialization of `total` is set to `0`. Instead, it should be initialized to `1` because multiplying anything by `0` will result in `0`, which will not yield the correct factorial.\n   - The condition in the `while` loop `while (num == num)` is always true and will lead to an infinite loop. You need a condition that will change and eventually terminate the loop.\n\n3. **Fixing the Loop**: \n   - You should change the loop condition to check if `num` is greater than `0`. This way, the loop will continue until `num` reaches `0`.\n   - Inside the loop, after multiplying `total` by `num`, you should also decrement `num` to move towards the base case (i.e., when `num` reaches `0`).\n\n4. **Handling Negative Numbers**: \n   - Factorials are only defined for non-negative integers. You should return an appropriate value or raise an error if a negative number is provided.\n\nHere's how to think about the changes you need to make to implement the above fixes:\n\n- Initialize `total` to `1`.\n- Change the `while` loop condition to check if `num` is greater than `0`.\n- Ensure to decrement `num` within the loop.\n\nWould you like to try making these changes?
