Understanding `onlyOneRightAnswer`\n- **Question**: How does `onlyOneRightAnswer` work?\n- **Hint**: Think about how the `while` loop functions in this method. What condition must be met for the loop to stop? What does this function do if the user's input is not equal to the `correctAnswer`?\n\n### 2. Analyzing `notAFactorial`\n- **Question**: How many times does `notAFactorial(9)` loop as it is currently written?\n- **Hint**: Consider the condition of the while loop (`while (num == num)`). What does this condition imply? How would you determine how many times it loops?\n\n- **Question**: What should we change about it to make it properly produce a factorial?\n- **Hint**: Look at the initialization of `total`. What should it start as for multiplication to work correctly? Also, think about how the multiplication should be structured within the loop.\n\n### 3. Modifying `askForInput`\n- **Question**: How could we edit `askForInput()` to make it loop forever?\n- **Hint**: What kind of condition would cause the while loop to never stop? Can you think of an example that would always evaluate to `True`?\n\n### 4. Analyzing the while loop in `notAFactorial`\n- **Question**: How long does the actual while loop for `notAFactorial` run when ignoring what happens inside of it?\n- **Hint**: Focus on the condition of the while loop. What does `while(num == num)` imply about the loop's execution?\n\n### 5. Implementing `magic8`\n- For the function `magic8(num)`, think about how you can implement the rules given in the assignment. \n  - What kind of `if` statements will you need? \n  - What should be the first condition you check based on the rules provided? \n\n### Example of `if` Statements\nHere’s a basic structure of how an `if` statement looks in Python:\n\n```python\nif condition:\n    # code to execute if condition is true\nelif another_condition:\n    # code to execute if another_condition is true\nelse:\n    # code to execute if none of the conditions are true\n```\n\n### Testing Your Code\nOnce you've implemented your `magic8` function, think about how you would test it. You could add more test cases similar to those already included in `main()`.\n\nIf you have any specific parts you want to discuss further, let me know!"

How does it determine what the \"one right answer\" is?

Can you identify what might be missing or incorrect in the current implementation of this function? Think about the basic definition of a factorial and how it’s calculated.\n\n4. **Making `askForInput()` loop forever**:\n   - If you want to create an infinite loop, what condition would you need to set?
