What is the loop condition in `notAFactorial`?\n2. What happens with each iteration of the loop? Does the condition change?\n3.

When analyzing the `notAFactorial` function, it's important to differentiate between the types of loops and their purposes. \n\n1. **While Loop**: This loop will continue executing as long as its condition evaluates to `True`. You should check the condition used in the while loop. Is it something that could potentially change or will it always remain the same?\n\n2. **If Statement**: This is used for conditional execution. It allows you to run certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`. \n\nTo answer your question, it would be helpful to look closely at the conditions in both the while loop and any if statements. \n\n- Ask yourself: What is the condition of the while loop? How many times will it run based on that condition? \n- For the if statements, are they correctly placed to handle different cases within the loop? \n\nTry to break down the logic in the `notAFactorial` function and see how both the if statements and the while loop interact with each other.

To fix this, you should start `total` at 1 instead of 0, as multiplying by 0 will always give you 0.\n\nSo, your task is to:\n- Change the while loop condition to something that will eventually become false (like `num > 0`).\n- Initialize `total` to 1 to properly compute the factorial.\n\nHow might you implement those changes?"
