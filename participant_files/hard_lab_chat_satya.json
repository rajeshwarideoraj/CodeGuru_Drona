This method adds an item to the end of the list.\n\nHere's the basic syntax for using `append()`:\n\n```python\nmy_list = []  # an empty list\nmy_list.append(\"my_string\")  # this adds \"my_string\" to my_list\n```\n\nYou can also use the `insert()` method if you want to add the string at a specific index. The syntax looks like this:\n\n```python\nmy_list.insert(index, \"my_string\")  # adds \"my_string\" at the specified index\n```\n\nWhat do you think would be the best approach for your assignment? Would you want to add a string directly to the list, or would you need to manipulate the list in some way first?"
